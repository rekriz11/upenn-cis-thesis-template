In this chapter, we presented a model for simplification that first identifies complex words in texts, and then ranks lexical simplification candidates according to their adequacy in these specific contexts. 
We performed experiments showing that our model makes correct simplification suggestions 35\% of the time as measured by top-1 accuracy (versus 20\% of the time for the best baseline), and produces a good substitution in its top-5 predictions 60\% of the time (versus 44\% for the best baseline). We performed a detailed error analysis that suggests future improvements, e.g. not replacing words within collocations like {\it elementary school}, and extending the context model to include the arguments of words that are going to be simplified.
